        <div style="text-align:justify;">
            <p>What if the spirit that God instilled in us originally was a spirit without curiosity?</p>

            <p>God first planted Adam and Eve in the garden. He asked them to take care of the garden, name the animals, be fruitful and multiply. He merely asked them to live life and to have fun, but to not eat from the fruit of THAT tree. </p>
            
            <p>The snake came and tempted Eve, saying that her eyes will be opened if she eats this apple. Eve did not understand, but she was tempted. Eve eventually gave in. Why did she give in? Was it from a place of merely sin, of which it is disobeying God? Or was it from a place of curiosity? "Oh, I can be the same as God?", "My eyes will be opened?"</p>
            
            <p><em>What if it was a spark of curiosity that resulted in disobedience towards God?</em> <br>After all, were they expected to know any better?</p>
            
            <p>If this was a valid point of view, then is not that which all form of modern technology is built upon, i.e philosophy, mathematics and science fundamentally opposing God? God wanted us to be simple. Enjoy the fruits, take care of the garden and multiply, while worshiping Him. But if we embark on a journey that demands a further understanding of the world, powered by curiosity, then is it not fundamentally going against the initial spirit that God put into us? </p>
            
            <p>But what is the motivation behind science? What is the motivation behind philosophy, mathematics (and much more...)? Is it not curiosity at its core? Is it not ultimately a pursuit of a better understanding of all that is around us, i.e. nature, and all its natural and human consequences? Does it not demand from its pursuers the utmost rigorousness in thinking, such that all knowledge built before them and after be well established and ready to be further built upon? It does this for a deeper and better understanding of the world we live in. All of this is a consequence of the curiosity of human nature; curiosity that would not have otherwise been birthed if not for the choice that Eve made in eating that apple. For it was after eating the apple did we as humans gain self-consciousness, and were it not for this would we result in a pursuit of science; unless this assumption is taken to be false, in which case all preceding arguments are invalidated. </p>
